Tasks 0:

Part A
You have a random names of 1000 students in BSE and the interest is check whether the name "Patrick" is available. You are required write an algorithm that will linear search throughout the names and return the text "found" upon finding the name. Else, it will return "name not found". The algorithm will be tested on a small sample of names and the it will be generalized with names can be a very big number as "n".

What will be running time function (T(n)) for the algorithm
What will be the asymptotic notation of the running time function (T(n))
What will be the best case scenario, average case scenario, and the worst case scenario.
Part B

You have the same 1000 students ordered in the ascending and you are required to search the same name but you are asked to used binary search. Still test the algorithm on small data set but consider big inputs as n.

What will be the running time function T(n) for the algorithm used.
Use Master's method to solve the equation and determine the time complexity in big oh notation.
Which algorithm performs better between part A and part B.
 

Task 1

Peter is a data engineer in a company and advised the company to store data using linked lists instead of arrays. He insists that accessing data and removing data will be achieved with a greater performances. To test the idea, we have 10 numbers (any random numbers). The 10 numbers will be used to test performance of algorithms on arrays and linked lists.

Write a program that will add a new element to the beginning of the array (after testing it with 10 elements generalize it with the input as n)
Write a program that will add a new element to the beginning of the a linked list (after testing it with 10 elements generalize it with the input as n)
Which algorithm performs better between A and B. Use the asymptotic time complexity of each algorithm to backup the answer.
Task 2

Sorting elements is part of different applications in computer. Consider an algorithm that sorts n names(first name and last name) using bubble sort algorithms and consider the same dataset sorted in ascending order using a merge sort algorithm.

What is the running time function of the bubblesort algorithm? What is the time complexity in big oh notation?
What is the running time function of the mergesort algorithm? What is the time complexity in big oh notation?
